# Tactics

## Setup

First, install dependencies:

    # Linuxbrew and clojure
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    brew install clojure/tools/clojure

    yarn

Then, start up all the servers with:

    ./run.zsh

You might need to open ports 3000, 5000, and 9630 to connect from another
machine.
On linux with UFW you can do this with:

```
sudo ufw allow 3000
sudo ufw allow 5000
sudo ufw allow 9630
```

## Deployment

### As a static web page (frontend only)

Use a "release" script like at
https://github.com/kovasap/reddit-tree/blob/main/release.bash.

### On Raspberry Pi

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt install yarn
curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.11.1.1273.sh
chmod +x linux-install-1.11.1.1273.sh
sudo ./linux-install-1.11.1.1273.sh
sudo cp app.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable app.service
systemctl start app.service
# To read logs:
journalctl -u app.service
```

Set up port forwarding on router to forward ports 3000, 5000, 9630 to the
raspberry pi's IP address.

Set up duckdns to point to the IP at https://www.whatismyip.com/.

Now anyone can access the game at kovas.duckdns.org:3000!

### Individual Server Startup

You can start the frontend service with:

    clj -M:frontend

You find the application at http://localhost:8700.

Start the backend API with this alias:

    clj -M:api

Find the backend server's documentation at: http://localhost:3000
