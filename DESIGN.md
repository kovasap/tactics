## Story

Main character has the ability to see the immediate intentions of others.

At first, they just notice this ability and start using it to prevent people
from doing bad things.
Eventually they uncover a deep conspiracy.
When investigating the conspiracy, there is a pivotal moment where their
intention reading seems to have been wrong (and maybe some small moments leading
up to this)!

...

Eventually they learn that their intention reading is granted to them by a
spirit/demon that will sometimes warp what they see to serve their own
intentions.

### Outline

#### Preface

Florian is woken up by his roommate Leo - they planned to go to the market
together and are running late.

#### Chapter 1: Scrap at the Market

As they get to the market, Florian has a vision of someone assassinating someone
else before it happens.  He reflexively bumps the assassin and draws his anger.

The assassin accuses Floian of "being in league with the academy heretics".

The would be target, Asmond, joins up with Florian and Leo as they fight off the
assassins.

The battle involves killing one assassin and then fleeing to a safe tile as a
much more powerful assassin chases them.

After the battle, Asmond, Florian, and Leo regroup and try to figure out what is
going on.  They decide to go to the city gaurd to report the incident.

#### Chapter 2: Corrupted

The gaurds immediately jail them for the murder of the one assassin.

While they are in jail, some other assassins come to finish them off.

Of of the assassins, Viriis has some doubts about what their co-assassins are
doing.
If someone talks to her during the fight she will join the party.

Upon defeating the assassins, they all decide to flee the city.

#### Chapter 3: Survival and Answers

The group get a room in a local village inn.
This inn promptly gets attacked by bandits.

One of the bandits is recruitable.

#### Chapter 4:

#### Chapter 5:


## Characters

## Lore / World

Characters have affinities for different elements, as described at
https://github.com/kovasap/journey_game/blob/master/spec/spec.md#elements.  This
affinity could be used instead of "class" when character building.


## Gameplay

Grid based tactics.
Whenever you plan out your character's move (before committing it), you will see
what all other characters will do in response.

Maybe this ability could be togglable.

## Overworld

Similar to Wargroove, you advance to the next chapter by travelling on an
overworld.
However, unlike wargroove, there are more chapters spiderwebbing out into
different biomes.
After completing optional chapters in these biomes, NPCs will teach you about
new classes your characters can now adopt.

### World Layout

The world is a sprawling continent with six radially distributed regions, each
with affinity to a different element.
In the center of the world there is a large region that has no constant dominant
element, but rather goes through cycles of dominance over time.
The world has six seasons, one for each element, and the central region is
swayed to one element or another based on the season.
