## Story

Main character has the ability to see the immediate intentions of others.

At first, they just notice this ability and start using it to prevent people
from doing bad things.
Eventually they uncover a deep conspiracy.
When investigating the conspiracy, there is a pivotal moment where their
intention reading seems to have been wrong (and maybe some small moments leading
up to this)!

...

Eventually they learn that their intention reading is granted to them by a
spirit/demon that will sometimes warp what they see to serve their own
intentions.


## Lore / World

Characters have affinities for different elements, as described at
https://github.com/kovasap/journey_game/blob/master/spec/spec.md#elements.  This
affinity could be used instead of "class" when character building.


## Gameplay

Grid based tactics.
Whenever you plan out your character's move (before committing it), you will see
what all other characters will do in response.

Maybe this ability could be togglable.
